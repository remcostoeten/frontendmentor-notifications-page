          <p>Small case project from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io" target="blank">Frontend mentor</a>. Site
            where you pick your challenge and get all the files and info necessary to complete the case without
            guidance. Only after completing the case feedback is possible.
            All the necessary info is given e.g. styleguide, case overview, logic and design files (in my case only
            JPG's hence the spacing and sizes might be a bit off) are given, and only after finishing the repo it's
            possible to get feedback if you want, not prior, to promote learning to debug etc.</p>
          <p><br>Goal for me was to practice some basic JS principles and showcase my style of writing SASS and HTML
            althrough admittedly it could be neater. For a large project I would setup the SASS structure a bit more
            efficient and extensive. Link to my github repo <a href="https://github.com/remcostoeten/frontendmentor-notifications-page" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontend Mentor</a> challenges help you improve your coding
                  skills by
                  building realistic projects.</p>
                <p><strong>To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong>
                </p>
                <h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
                <p>Your challenge is to build out this notifications page and get it looking as close to the design as
                  possible.</p>
                <p>You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you&#39;ve got something
                  you&#39;d like to
                  practice, feel free to give it a go.</p>
                <p>Your users should be able to: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Distinguish between &quot;unread&quot; and &quot;read&quot; notifications</li>
                  <li>Select &quot;Mark all as read&quot; to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set
                    the number of
                    unread messages to zero</li>
                  <li>View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device&#39;s screen size</li>
                  <li>See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Want some support on the challenge? <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack">Join our Slack
                    community</a> and
                  ask questions in the <strong>#help</strong> channel.</p>
                <h2 id="where-to-find-everything">Where to find everything</h2>
                <p>Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the <code>/design</code> folder. You will
                  find both a
                  mobile and a desktop version of the design. </p>
                <p>The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you&#39;ll need to use your best
                  judgment for styles
                  such as <code>font-size</code>, <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code>. </p>
                <p>If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch &amp; Figma versions) to inspect the design in
                  more detail, you
                  can <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro">subscribe as a PRO member</a>.</p>
                <p>All the required assets for this project are in the <code>/assets</code> folder. The images are
                  already exported for
                  the correct screen size and optimized.</p>
                <p>We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can
                  choose to either link
                  to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we&#39;ve removed
                  the static font
                  files for the font weights that aren&#39;t needed for this project.</p>
                <p>There is also a <code>style-guide.md</code> file containing the information you&#39;ll need, such as
                  color palette
                  and fonts.</p>
                <h2 id="building-your-project">Building your project</h2>
                <p>Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do
                  not feel like you
                  need to follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Initialize your project as a public repository on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
                    Creating a repo will
                    make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you&#39;re not sure how to
                    do this, <a href="https://try.github.io/">have a read-through of this Try Git resource</a>.</li>
                  <li>Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you
                    need some help
                    during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number
                    of ways to do
                    this, and we provide some recommendations below.</li>
                  <li>Look through the designs to start planning out how you&#39;ll tackle the project. This step is
                    crucial to help you
                    think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.</li>
                  <li>Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus
                    your attention
                    on creating well-structured content.</li>
                  <li>Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as
                    <code>font-family</code> and
                    <code>font-size</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once
                    you&#39;re happy
                    you&#39;ve completed the area you&#39;re working on.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2 id="deploying-your-project">Deploying your project</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. <a
                    href="https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe">Read
                    more about our
                    recommended and trusted hosts</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="create-a-custom-readmemd">Create a custom <code>README.md</code></h2>
                <p>We strongly recommend overwriting this <code>README.md</code> with a custom one. We&#39;ve provided a
                  template inside
                  the <a href="./README-template.md"><code>README-template.md</code></a> file in this starter code.</p>
                <p>The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom <code>README</code> will help you explain
                  your project and
                  reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.</p>
                <p>Once you&#39;ve added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the
                  <code>README-template.md</code> file to <code>README.md</code>. That will make it show up as your
                  repository&#39;s
                  README file.
